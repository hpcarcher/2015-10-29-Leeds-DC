<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.archer.ac.uk">ARCHER</a>, the UK's national
  supercomputing service, offers training in software development and
  high-performance computing to scientists and researchers across the
  UK. As part of our training service we are running a 2 day Data
  Carpentry workshop. 
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">Software Sustanability Institute</a>'s mission is to cultivate better, more sustainable, research software to enable world-class research (<a href="http://softwaresaved.spreadshirt.co.uk/"><em>better software, better research</em></a>). Software is fundamental to research: <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2014-12-04-its-impossible-conduct-research-without-software-say-7-out-10-uk-researchers">seven out of ten UK researchers report that their work would be impossible without it</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://datacarpentry.github.io/">Data Carpentry</a>
  develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Our mission is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. Data Carpentry is a sibling organization of Software Carpentry. Where Software Carpentry teaches best practices in software development, our focus is on the introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research. Our lessons are domain specific, from life and physical sciences to social science and build on the existing knowledge of learners to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research. Our initial target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational experience. We create a friendly environment for learning to empower researchers and enable data driven discovery.
</p>
<p>
  This workshop is being run by <a
  href="http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk">EPCC</a>, as part of ARCHER. The
  workshop is in collaboration with EPCC's <a
  href="http://www.prace-project.eu/PRACE-Advanced-Training-Centres">PRACE
  Advanced Training Centre</a> (PATC), and <a
  href="http://datacarpentry.github.io/">Data Carpentry</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The workshop is aimed at faculty, research staff, postdocs, graduate students, advanced undergraduates, and other researchers in any field. No prior computational experience is required.
  </br>
  You should also be comfortable with using the bash shell. For an introduction to the shell, please see, for example, Software Carpentry's lessons on <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/shell/">The Unix Shell</a>.

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop, 
  you will need working copies of the software described below.
  Please make sure to install everything and try opening it to make sure it works 
  <em>before</em> the start of your workshop. If you run into any problems,
please feel free to email the instructor or arrive early to your workshop on 
the first day.
  
Participants should bring and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup of 
tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.

<p>This workshop will be using the software outlined in the install instructions below. 
Please see the section for your operating system for those directions.
<ul>
<li><a href=#windows>Windows</a>
<li><a href=#mac>Mac</a>
<li><a href=#linux>Linux</a>
</ul>
